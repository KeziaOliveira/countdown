# Regressive counter project

I was challenged by a friend to make this reference to a series we liked

## Reference

This project is a reference to the website used in the series How I Met Your Mother, episode "Slap Bet" (Season 2, Episode 9)

## How does it works?

A countdown is implemented using JavaScript's setInterval function, which repeatedly calls the updateCountdown function every second. The updateCountdown function calculates the time difference between the current date and a specified future date. It then updates the HTML to display the remaining time, breaking it down into days, hours, minutes, and seconds. This ensures that the countdown dynamically reflects the time left in real-time
